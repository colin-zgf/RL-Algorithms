# SAC (Proposed in 2018)

## Background

Soft Actor Critic (SAC) is an algorithm which optimizes a stochastic policy in an off-policy way, forming a bridge between stochastic policy optimization and DDPG-style approaches. It isnâ€™t a direct successor to TD3 (having been published roughly concurrently), but it incorporates the clipped double-Q trick, and due to the inherent stochasticity of the policy in SAC, it also winds up benefiting from something like target policy smoothing. 

A central feature of SAC is entropy regularization. The policy is trained to maximize a trade-off between expected return and entropy, a measure of randomness in the policy. This has a close connection to the exploration-exploitation trade-off: increasing entropy results in more exploration, which can accelerate learning later on. It can also prevent the policy from prematurely converging to a bad local optimum. SAC incorporates the entropy measure of the policy into the reward to encourage exploration: we expect to learn a policy that acts as randomly as possible while it is still able to succeed at the task. It is an off-policy actor-critic model following the maximum entropy reinforcement learning framework. A precedent work is Soft Q-learning.

Three key components in SAC:

- An actor-critic architecture with separate policy and value function networks;
- An off-policy formulation that enables reuse of previously collected data for efficiency;
- Entropy maximization to enable stability and exploration.

The policy is trained with the objective to maximize the expected return and the entropy at the same time:
