## Very Important Note

**If you would like to see all formulas in all .md file, please add the MathJax Plugin. The steps to add the plugin is to search the [Chrome app store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions) and type 'mathjax' in the 'search' section. Then add MathJax Plugin for Github**

Policy gradient is an approach to solve reinforcement learning problems. If you haven’t looked into the field of reinforcement learning, please first read the section “A (Long) Peek into Reinforcement Learning » Key Concepts” for the problem definition and key concepts.
